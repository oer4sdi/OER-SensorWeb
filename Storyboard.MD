## Spatial Data Infrastructure

The ability to access, process, and integrate data from various sources for mapping, visualisation, and other forms of representation and analysis is known as Interoperability. Often organisations such as the European Union share the data among themselves to insure data interoperability. But without specific standards, interoperability is not possible. To ensure the specific needs of each data and its formats, we have Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI).
Spatial Data Infrastructure(SDI) is defined as a framework of policies, institutional arrangements, technologies, data, and people that enables the sharing and effective usage of geographic information by standardising formats and protocols for access and interoperability.

For instance:

***the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) directive is a European Union (EU) directive that took effect on May 15, 2007, requiring EU members to establish a spatial data infrastructure via the Internet that allows for the standardised sharing of geographic information. INSPIRE became the legal framework for developing SDI throughout the EU in order to facilitate interoperability.***

Some examples are the EU Initiative INSPIRE (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community) or GEOSS (Global Earth Observation System of Systems).
The latter aims to establish a global public infrastructure to provide near-real-time environmental data. 

## Sensor Data
Data that are collected from various heterogeneous internet of things (IoT) devices. Sensor data is the output of a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The output may be used to provide information or input to another system or to guide a process. Sensors can be used to detect just about any physical element. Here are a few examples of sensors, just to give an idea of the number and diversity of their applications:

+ A photosensor detects the presence of visible light, infrared transmission (IR) and/or ultraviolet (UV) energy. 
+ A temperature sensor detects the land surface temperature on the ground.

For example: In kaggle, a dataset sharing platform we have many sensor datasets. Air Quality Dataset is the most commonly used sensordata. This dataset contains the responses of a gas multisensor device deployed on the field in an Italian city.

***Did you know? Your smartphone is so smart that it can act as a mobile sensor.***

Using Sensor data over other spatial data sources such as remote sensing imageries, CAD has numerous advantages.
